# Identifying-High-Risk-Borrowers-Predicting-Loan-Defaults.
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict loan defaults, helping financial institutions identify high-risk borrowers. By analyzing key features such as credit score, income, and loan-to-income ratio, the model aims to enhance decision-making in credit risk assessment and reduce financial losses.
